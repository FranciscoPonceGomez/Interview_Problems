#This problem was asked by Google.

#You are given given a list of rectangles represented by min and max x- and y-coordinates. Compute whether or not a pair of rectangles overlap each other. If one rectangle completely covers another, it is considered overlapping.

#For example, given the following rectangles:

#{
#    "top_left": (1, 4),
#    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
#},
#{
#    "top_left": (-1, 3),
#    "dimensions": (2, 1)
#},
#{
#    "top_left": (0, 5),
#    "dimensions": (4, 3)
#}

#return true as the first and third rectangle overlap each other.

def overlapping(rectangles):
    x_values = []
    y_values = []
    for rect in rectangles:
        x_values.append(range(rect.get('top_left')[0], rect.get('dimensions')[0]))
        y_values.append(range(rect.get('top_left')[1], rect.get('dimensions')[1]))
    # if both x range of numbers and y range of numbers are common they overlap
    total_x, total_y = set(), set()
    for x in x_values:
        total_x = set(x) - total_x
